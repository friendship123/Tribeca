  My name is Sophie in this website you will be able to see alot of what we do on these tours. You can also sign up on the navigation bar above. Please make sure to comment if you have any questions. I am doing these tours so that people can get a glimpse into the real new york. And also you get a slight glimpse of kids mindset and how they think like the best ice cream stores or playgrounds. And for the adults you get a slight history of the neighborhood. we do sell small snacks and beverages for $2-4
